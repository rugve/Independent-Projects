# Independent-Projects

A collection of quantitative finance projects where I explore machine learning applications in trading and portfolio management.

## Projects

### ML-Driven Portfolio Optimization
*Aug 2024 – Dec 2024*

Built a machine learning system to optimize a multi-sector U.S. portfolio for different market conditions. I compared three ML models (Random Forest, SVM, and Deep Neural Networks) and integrated macroeconomic data from FRED API to improve predictions. The Deep Neural Network performed best for risk-adjusted returns, while SVM showed great resilience during market downturns.

### Pairs Trading with ML and Cointegration
*Aug 2024 – Nov 2024*

Developed a pairs trading strategy that combines statistical cointegration analysis with machine learning. I used Random Forest and SVM to generate trading signals based on Z-scores for sector-diverse stock pairs. The backtesting confirmed that pairing sectors together actually enhances long/short strategy performance.

### Breakout Strategy Optimization
*Apr 2024 – Jun 2024*

Created and backtested a triple moving average breakout strategy across global markets (Nifty50, SPY, Hang Seng). I used grid search to fine-tune parameters and achieved solid performance with reasonable risk metrics, though I identified areas where risk management could be improved.

### Monte Carlo Risk Modeling
*Nov 2023 – Feb 2024*

Built a risk assessment framework using Monte Carlo simulations to calculate Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall for portfolios. I implemented multiple VaR approaches and used statistical tests to validate the models, successfully reducing tail risk through better risk estimation.

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python  
**ML Models:** Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks  
**Data:** FRED API, financial market data  
**Methods:** Cointegration analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, statistical testing  

## What I Learned

These projects taught me how to apply machine learning to real financial problems, from portfolio construction to risk management. I got hands-on experience with everything from data collection and feature engineering to backtesting and performance evaluation.
